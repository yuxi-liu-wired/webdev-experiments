title: About Me
---

I am Yuxi Liu (刘宇曦), a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Andrew Zisserman](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/). I am also a member of the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/).

My research interests include computer vision and machine learning. I am particularly interested in the intersection of these two fields, such as deep learning, 3D vision, and video understanding.
